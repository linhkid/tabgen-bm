class HillClimbSearch(StructureEstimator):
    """
    Class for heuristic hill climb searches for DAGs, to learn
    network structure from data. `estimate` attempts to find a model with optimal score.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: pandas DataFrame object
        dataframe object where each column represents one variable.
        (If some values in the data are missing the data cells should be set to `numpy.NaN`.
        Note that pandas converts each column containing `numpy.NaN`s to dtype `float`.)

    state_names: dict (optional)
        A dict indicating, for each variable, the discrete set of states (or values)
        that the variable can take. If unspecified, the observed values in the data set
        are taken to be the only possible states.

    use_caching: boolean
        If True, uses caching of score for faster computation.
        Note: Caching only works for scoring methods which are decomposable. Can
        give wrong results in case of custom scoring methods.

        Performs local hill climb search to estimates the `DAG` structure that
        has optimal score, according to the scoring method supplied. Starts at
        model `start_dag` and proceeds by step-by-step network modifications
        until a local maximum is reached. Only estimates network structure, no
        parametrization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scoring_method: str or StructureScore instance
            The score to be optimized during structure estimation.  Supported
            structure scores: k2score, bdeuscore, bdsscore, bicscore, aicscore. Also accepts a
            custom score, but it should be an instance of `StructureScore`.

        start_dag: DAG instance
            The starting point for the local search. By default, a completely
            disconnected network is used.

        fixed_edges: iterable
            A list of edges that will always be there in the final learned model.
            The algorithm will add these edges at the start of the algorithm and
            will never change it.

        tabu_length: int
            If provided, the last `tabu_length` graph modifications cannot be reversed
            during the search procedure. This serves to enforce a wider exploration
            of the search space. Default value: 100.

        max_indegree: int or None
            If provided and unequal None, the procedure only searches among models
            where all nodes have at most `max_indegree` parents. Defaults to None.

        black_list: list or None
            If a list of edges is provided as `black_list`, they are excluded from the search
            and the resulting model will not contain any of those edges. Default: None

        white_list: list or None
            If a list of edges is provided as `white_list`, the search is limited to those
            edges. The resulting model will then only contain edges that are in `white_list`.
            Default: None

        epsilon: float (default: 1e-4)
            Defines the exit condition. If the improvement in score is less than `epsilon`,
            the learned model is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        Estimated model: pgmpy.model.BayesianNetwork
            A `Bayesian Network` at a (local) score maximum.
